## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Triage Flow

1. **Symptom Input**: Describe your symptoms in natural language
   ```
   "I have been experiencing sharp chest pain and shortness of breath"
   ```

2. **AI Analysis**: The system analyzes symptoms and asks clarifying questions
   ```
   "How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?"
   "On a scale of 1-10, how severe is the pain?"
   ```

3. **Triage Assessment**: Receive a clear urgency level
   - 🔴 **High Priority** - Seek immediate emergency care
   - 🟡 **Moderate Priority** - Visit urgent care within hours
   - 🟢 **Low Priority** - Schedule routine care or self-care

4. **Care Navigation**: Get personalized recommendations
   ```
   📍 Nearby Options:
   • City Emergency Room - 0.3 miles, 45 min wait
   • Urgent Care Center - 1.2 miles, 15 min wait, $150
   • Telehealth Consult - Available now, $49
   ```

### Advanced Features

#### Image Upload
Upload photos of visible symptoms (rashes, injuries, etc.) for enhanced analysis.

#### Location Services
Enable location services for accurate nearby provider recommendations.

#### Insurance Integration
Specify your insurance provider for coverage-aware suggestions.
